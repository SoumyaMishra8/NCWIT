Please find my research paper on my research that I conducted in the Academy of Science as part of our research curriculum. 
This was the research I conducted last year and the beginning of my senior year. 
I am continuing this project right now and am submitting this research to the Regeneron Science Talent Search. 
I took this research to the Intel Regional Science and Engineering Fair in my junior year and placed 3rd in my category, Systems Software. 
I was also one of two researchers out of the 200+ participants to receive five or more special awards from various sponsors. I was one of the two juniors to receive the MIT Club of Washington D.C. award, one of the three participants to receive the US Army Force award, one of the two to receive Mu Alpha Theta award, and also received the Aerospace Corporation and Institute of Electrical and Technical Engineers (IEEE) award.
